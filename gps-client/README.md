## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

Our client is developed using React and scaffolded with `create-react-app`. It provides the user interface for interacting with the transcription service, allowing users to upload audio files, view and edit transcriptions, and export the results.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

To set up the client for development or deployment, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `transcribe-client/` directory:
    ```sh
    cd transcribe-client/
    ```
    
2. Install the project dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage<a name="usage"></a>

For development purposes, you can run the client in two modes:

- **Development Mode with Mock Backend**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This mode runs the client with mock backend interactions, suitable for UI development without requiring the actual backend.

- **Standard Development Mode**:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    This mode runs the client with calls to the actual backend enabled, suitable for full-stack development and testing.

## Folder Structure<a name="folder-structure"></a>
