# Smart Waste Management System

This repository contains the embedded software for a smart waste management system designed to automate and optimize waste handling through intelligent sensing and communication technologies.

## Key Features

- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication**: Configures and manages WiFi settings and device serial numbers via BLE.
- **GPS Tracking**: Captures precise geographical coordinates to track waste management assets.
- **Distance Measurement**: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the fill level of waste containers.
- **WiFi Communication**: Handles data transmission between the device and a central server.

## Components

- `BLESetup.h`: Manages BLE services and characteristics for WiFi setup.
- `GPSHandler.h`: Captures GPS data and parses the GNGGA (Global Navigation Satellite System Fix Data) sentence to retrieve latitude and longitude.
- `Sensor.h`: Computes distance measurements using ultrasonic sensors to determine the fill level of waste bins.
- `SerialNumberHandler.h`: Manages device serial numbers stored in EEPROM, allowing for identification and tracking.
- `WiFiCommunication.h`: Facilitates communication with a server over WiFi to transmit location and status data.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller**: Compatible with ESP8266/ESP32 modules.
- **Sensors**: Ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement.
- **GPS Module**: To capture geographic coordinates.
- **BLE Module**: For configuring network settings remotely.

## Software Setup

### Dependencies

- Arduino IDE or compatible IDE for code compilation and uploading.
- Libraries:
  - `ArduinoBLE.h` for BLE functionality.
  - `EEPROM.h` for non-volatile storage handling.
  - `SoftwareSerial.h` for serial communication with the GPS module.
  - `WiFiS3.h` or similar for handling WiFi operations.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-repository/smart-waste-management-system.git
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the required libraries via the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE.
4. Connect the hardware as per the wiring diagram provided in the docs folder.
5. Upload the code to your microcontroller.

### Usage
Once the device is powered and running, it operates autonomously to measure waste levels and sends data to the central server when thresholds are met. It uses GPS to update location statuses and manages device settings and status through a BLE interface.

### Configuration
Use any BLE-enabled smartphone or device to connect and set up WiFi credentials.
The device serial number can be managed through a similar BLE interface.
